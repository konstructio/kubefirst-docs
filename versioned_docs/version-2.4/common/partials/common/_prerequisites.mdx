### Docker Desktop

[Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) Docker Desktop.

:::info

If you are a Windows user, you need to be sure to enable Docker support in WSL2 distros. More information in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/#enabling-docker-support-in-wsl-2-distros).

#### Docker Resources Allocation

The more resources you give Docker, the faster your cluster creation will go, but here are the minimum requirements:

- CPU: 5 Cores
- Memory (RAM): 5 GB
- Swap: 1 GB
- Virtual Disk limit (for Docker images & containers): 10 GB

If you pull multiple images from Docker Hub, you may reach the [rate limit](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/#whats-the-download-rate-limit-on-docker-hub): to help this issue not happening, we suggest you log in to your account (you can [create a free one](https://hub.docker.com/signup)) in Docker Desktop. At the time of writing this docs, the limit is doubled when signed in.
