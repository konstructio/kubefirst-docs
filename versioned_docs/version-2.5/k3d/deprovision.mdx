# Deprovision

The command will also delete everything added to your GitHub or GitLab account, while cleaning local files related to your deployment.

```shell
kubefirst k3d destroy
```

## Removing CA from the Trusted Store

If you [installed the mkcert CA (Certificate Authority) to your trusted store,](../k3d/quick-start/install.mdx#install-the-ca-certificate-authority-of-mkcert-in-your-trusted-store) you can remove it with:

```shell
mkcert -uninstall
```

## Reset (optional)

You can use the `kubefirst reset` command to clean local files generated by the installer while leaving the logs file, and the [SSL certificates that you backed up](../aws/advanced/certificates.mdx) untouched. This command will not destroy your cluster (cloud resources or k3d), and is not a replacement for the `destroy` command.
