### Install the CA (Certificate Authority) of mkcert in your trusted store

We use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate local certificates and serve `https` with the Traefik Ingress Controller. During the installation, Kubefirst generates these certificates and pushes them to Kubernetes as secrets to attach to Ingress resources.

To allow the applications running in your Kubefirst platform in addition to your browser to trust the certificates generated by your Kubefirst local install, you need to install the CA (Certificate Authority) of mkcert in your trusted store. To do so, follow these simple steps:

```shell
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
```

This is not an optional step: the cluster creation will fail if you don't install the mkcert CA in your trusted store.

If you are using Firefox, you have one more step: you need to install the [Network Security Services](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/index.html) (NSS):

```shell
brew install nss
```
        <GitHubClusterCreateCmd />
        <CommonTerminalOutput cloud="Azure"  minutes="20" handoffScreen={GitHubHandoffScreen} />
    </TabItem>
