## Azure

### What authentication methods do you support?

Currently, the only supported authentication method is a service principal with a client secret. Support for service principals with certificates is likely to be supported in the future. Please see [konstructio/kubefirst#2319](https://github.com/konstructio/kubefirst/issues/2319) for details and up-vote if you depend on this feature to use Kubefirst.

There are no plans to support authentication without a service principal.
