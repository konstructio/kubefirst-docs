### GitLab

- Create or use an existing [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com).
- Create a [GitLab group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/) with the name you want.
- A GitLab [personal access token](../../../common/git-auth.mdx) for your `kbot` account.

:::note
GitLab SaaS offering has limitations that require us to use groups contrary to GitHub which can be use without an organization.

:::info
If you want to use GitLab self-managed, you can update your GitOps repository and Kubernetes cluster once the creation is done following [this tutorial](https://blog.konstruct.io/self-hosting-gitlab/).
