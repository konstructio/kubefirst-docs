The kubefirst CLI will produce a directory of utilities, a state file, and some staged platform content that can now be found in the `~/.kubefirst` and `~/.k1` folders on your local machine.

After the ~ {props.minutes} minute installation, your browser will launch a new tab to the <a href="https://github.com/kubefirst/console">kubefirst Console</a>, which will help you navigate your new suite of tools running in your new {props.cloud} cluster.

If your deployment is not successful, errors and troubleshooting information will be stored in a local log file specified during the installation run.
