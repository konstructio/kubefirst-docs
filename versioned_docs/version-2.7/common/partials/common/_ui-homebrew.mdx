**No cluster? No problem!** Let us create your bootstrap cluster for you as well. We'll install our provisioning tool into it to create your permanent infrastructure.

```shell
brew install konstructio/taps/kubefirst

kubefirst launch up
```

Then connect to the provisioning tool at [https://console.kubefirst.dev](https://console.kubefirst.dev )

:::note
The `kubefirst.dev` domain is only available after `kubefirst launch up` and resolves to the host machine.
