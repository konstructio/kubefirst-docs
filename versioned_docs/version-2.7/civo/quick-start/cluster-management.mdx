## GPU Clusters

Kubefirst includes support for Graphical Processing Units (GPU). This capability provides Civo users who are have requirements with the capacity to run Kubefirst with performance for larger workloads.

With a GPU cluster, deployment and scalability are easily managed for AI and Machine Learning through a simple setup and Kubefirst’s seamless scaling.

- Requirements for this feature are Civo Cloud and Kubefirst. Refer to [our documentation here to install Kubefirst](./install/cli.mdx)  and you can select a GPU cluster as soon as Kubefirst is deployed.
- Take advantage of high performance infrastructure with pricing starting at $0.79 per GPU/hour, for an NVIDIA GPU (H100, H200, A100, L40S) to manage demanding AI/ML workloads, including private AI and chat-based applications.
