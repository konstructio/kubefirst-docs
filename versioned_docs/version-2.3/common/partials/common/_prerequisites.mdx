## Prerequisites

### kubefirst

<!--tabs-->

#### macOS (Homebrew)

If you are on macOS, and have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed, you can run:

```shell
brew install kubefirst/tools/kubefirst
```

To upgrade an existing kubefirst CLI to the latest version run:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade kubefirst
```

#### macOS/Linux (asdf)

> Not maintained by kubefirst

It's best to run the latest version of kubefirst but if you already have asdf setup and prefer to use it, there is a [kubefirst plugin](https://github.com/Claywd/asdf-kubefirst) available to get kubefirst installed and running quickly with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/). Installation instructions for asdf are [here](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

Once you have asdf installed, just run the following commands to install the kubefirst plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin-add kubefirst https://github.com/Claywd/asdf-kubefirst.git
asdf install kubefirst latest
asdf global kubefirst latest
kubefirst version
```

#### Linux

You can download the latest build for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/releases). Once done, extract it, and ensure it's executable. You may need to use `sudo` for the `tar` or `chmod`` command.

```shell
tar --overwrite -xvf kubefirst_<VERSION>_linux_<ARCH>.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/ kubefirst && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubefirst
```

Now you can run `kubefirst`.

```shell
kubefirst version
```

#### Windows

We currenctly do not support Windows directly, but you can easily use kubefirst using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (tested with Ubuntu). To install the lastest WSL version, please follow the [Microsoft documentation on how to install Linux on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

:::info

If you are a Windows user, you need to be sure to enable Docker support in WSL2 distros. More information in the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/#enabling-docker-support-in-wsl-2-distros).
