# Install kubefirst From the CLI

Using the CLI to create your cluster directly without using the [UI](./ui) is a perfect alternative for automation. The end result will be the same, a new production-ready management Kubernetes cluster, but you won't have access to the useful additional features available within the UI.

:::info
For a similar and better experience, the CLI installation process is now using our API, which will create a cluster 0 using k3d. You can safely delete it once the management cluster is created. To do so, use the `destroy` command. It will not destroy your management cluster.
