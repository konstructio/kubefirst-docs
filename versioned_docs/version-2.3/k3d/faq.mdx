<FAQ cloud="k3d" />

## k3d

### Cannot connect to the Docker daemon

```shell
Error: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?
```

If Docker is running, and working properly (run `docker run hello-world` in your terminal to test it), but you get the error above while trying to create a cluster with k3d, it may be related to [this Docker issue](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6529). It was fixed a while ago, but it seems like the problem is back. Since it's a Docker issue, and that the Unix sockets default path should be `/var/run/docker.sock`, you can specify the path using the `DOCKER_HOST` variable:

```shell
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://$HOME/.docker/run/docker.sock"
```

### Using Rancher Desktop Instead of Docker Desktop

Firstly, you need to disable Traefik in your Rancher Desktop because our installation uses Traefik and port forwarding. Between the conflicts and the double routing, it's just easier to disable Traefik on Rancher Desktop.

#### macOS (Apple Silicon)

> This is experimental. It works, but all of the features it uses are considered beta or experimental by Rancher Desktop.

For Apple Silicon macOS, you need to enable a few features in Rancher Desktop before this works. Run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
rdctl set --container-engine.name docker \
    --kubernetes.options.traefik=false \
    --experimental.virtual-machine.type vz \
    --experimental.virtual-machine.use-rosetta=true \
    --experimental.virtual-machine.mount.type virtiofs \
    --experimental.virtual-machine.socket-vmnet=true
```

If you have any issues, reach out to us on our [Slack community](https://kubefirst.io/slack).

#### macOS (Intel)

Not yet tested.

#### Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on Windows

Rancher Desktop is not yet supported but Docker Desktop is with [WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). There are limitations within Rancher Desktop and how it manages volumes which prevent us from supporting it at this moment.

### Using nerdctl Instead of Docker

Creation via [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) isn't supported yet. k3d doesn't fully support it probably because it doesn't have an API that is publicly exposed like the Docker daemon. We need k3d to support nerdctl and containerd on WSL before we can add support in kubefirst.

### Using Lima Instead of Docker Desktop

We didn't try kubefirst k3d cluster creation with [Lima](https://github.com/lima-vm/lima) yet. If you are using it, let us know how it's working, and if you think it's something we can support with the existing codebase.
