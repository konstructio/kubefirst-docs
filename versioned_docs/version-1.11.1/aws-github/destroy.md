# Destroy

:::tip Avoid tools re-download

The kubefirstCLI downloads some tools used during cluster provisioning, for example, Terraform, Helm, and Kubectl, in versions compatible with Kubefirst and stores them in the K1 folder. If you are using Kubefirst to demo in conferences or using poor connections (mobile, hotels) you should consider using this additional flag ```--preserve-tools``` for each cycle of create/destroy. This will preserve tools downloaded and will save time and network bandwidth during cluster provisioning.

:::

## 1. Ensure .kubefirst file is in home directory

If you just recently ran install from your localhost, you'll already have the file on your localhost at ```~/.kubefirst``` that's needed to destroy. If you don't have this file locally, you'll need to download it from your s3 bucket that was created during provisioning and add it to your home directory.

## 2. Run destroy command

With your ~/.kubefirst file in place, run:

```shell
kubefirst cluster destroy
```

## 3. Clean files generated by the installer (optional)

As AWS selection will create S3 buckets, if you don't want to persist these buckets, run:

```shell
kubefirst clean  --destroy-buckets --destroy-confirm
```

Or

To remove the files generated locally and preserve the S3 buckets for future re-use, run:

```shell
kubefirst clean
```

:::info

This step it is not mandatory, but before any new execution of the kubefirst CLI installation for local or cloud selections you will be requested to execute this command, so installer can start from a fresh point.
