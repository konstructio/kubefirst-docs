## Local Platform Installation

`kubefirst` is the name of our command line tool that installs the Kubefirst platform to your local or cloud environment.

To use the local version of Kubefirst, you will need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You will need a github.com account.

![Kubefirst local installation diagram](../../../img/kubefirst/local/kubefirst-cluster-create.png)

### Prerequisites

- [To install kubefirst CLI](../overview.md#how-to-install-kubefirst-cli)
- [To install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- GitHub users will need [a personal github account](https://github.com/)
<!-- - GitLab users will need [a personal gitlab account](https://gitlab.com/) -->

> **2 Hour Expiration Warning**
> The ngrok tunnel used for kubefirst local has a 2-hour expiration unless you create an account with ngrok. This expiration will prevent you from using automated infrastructure as code through atlantis, but the rest of the platform will continue to function beyond that ngrok evaluation period. [Create an account with ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup) to prevent this.

<!-- TODO: [2.0] the above warning is being spiked actively to see if we can remove it from the system as a part of the 2.0 release. confirm when releasing. -->

## Create your new local cluster

To create a new Kubefirst cluster locally, run

```shell
kubefirst k3d create
```

More information on `kubefirst k3d`, including optional flags, can be discovered by running `kubefirst k3d help`.

Details about your execution will be logged to your `~/.k1/logs` directory.

We are able to create an ephemeral GitHub token that expires after 8 hours using a process that will prompt you in your browser for access. If you just need a quick environment this is a great frictionless approach. However if you need this environment longer than 8 hours, please follow our [github token guide](../../../explore/github-token.md) and export a more permanent token to your terminal.
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxx
```

When docker is provided 5 GB memory and 5 cpus the local kubefirst platform will provision in about 6 minutes and deprovision in about 1 minute.

### Installed Applications

Kubefirst provides a preconfigured set of platform tools powered by your new gitops repository. Operational knowledge of all applications is not necessary to begin using Kubefirst but is useful to understand your cluster.

A newly created local Kubefirst cluster contains:

- A private repo named `gitops` that contains all IaC and GitOps configurations that power the entire platform
- [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) - GitOps Continuous Delivery
- [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/) - Kubernetes Native Workflow Engine
- [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/) - Terraform Workflow Automation
- [Chart Museum](https://github.com/helm/chartmuseum) - Helm Chart Registry
- [External Secrets Operator](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets) - Syncs Kubernetes secrets with Vault secrets
- [GitHub Action Runner](https://github.com/features/actions) - Self Hosted GitHub Action Runner
- [Metaphor](https://github.com/kubefirst/metaphor-frontend-template) - A sample app to demonstrate CI/CD in on Kubernetes. Contains Devlopment, Staging, and Production environments.
- [Traefik](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) - Default Ingress Controller for K3D Clusters
- [Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) - Secrets Management

### How to resolve HTTPS Certificate Warnings

To resolve the warning that the browser shows when you access one of your applications, run the command:

```shell
mkcert -install
```

We use [Mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to generate local certificates and serve `https` with the Traefik Ingress Controller.

During installation, Kubefirst generates these certificates and pushes them to Kubernetes as secrets to attach to Ingress resources. The browser does not recognize auto-assigned certificates as trusted certificates and will generate security errors.

This step will install the CA (Certificate Authority) of MkCert in your trusted store and will allow the browser to trust in certificates generated by your Kubefirst local install.

### Atlantis and Ngrok integration

[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a tool that allows Kubefirst to expose a local server to the internet via an [ngrok Secure Tunnel](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/). Kubefirst opens an ngrok Secure Tunnel tunnel during the installation to send events to Atlantis. When the installation finishes, the terminal window hangs at the handoff screen.
If the handoff screen in your terminal is closed, the Kubefirst installation terminates and the Ngrok Secure Tunnel is closed.

<!-- TODO: 2.0 - check the legitimacy of the above before releasing docs -->

During cluster provisioning, Terraform communicates with the host machine to create the desired resources. When Atlantis is installed via Kubefirst, it will use ngrok to expose the Atlantis server to the internet via [webhook](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=gaw-usa-nua-search-blog-dsa&utm_adgroup=DSA-Guides-What_are_webhooks&utm_term=&utm_content=_pcrid_630760751271_pkw__pmt__pdv_c_slid__pgrid_145358980000_ptaid_dsa-1873981911115_&gclid=Cj0KCQiAw8OeBhCeARIsAGxWtUxZLa8mXxQUt484tVLVjTCCl3zlHEmklG2Gu-EXdy1u521wyIg6EcoaAlS5EALw_wcB).

## After installation

After the ~6 minute installation, your browser will launch a new tab to the [Kubefirst Console application](https://github.com/kubefirst/console), which will help you navigate your new suite of tools running in your local k3d cluster.
