title: Destroy
---

To destroy your kubefirst cluster , run the `kubefirst <platform> destroy`.

<!--tabs-->
# AWS

```shell
kubefirst aws destroy
```

# Civo

```shell
kubefirst cluster destroy
```

# k3d

```shell
kubefirst k3d destroy
```
<!--/tabs-->

The command will also delete everything added to your GitHub or GitLab account, while cleaning local files related to your deployment.

## reset (optional)

If the `destroy` command isn't successful, you can use the `kubefirst reset` command. It will clean local files generated by the installer while leaving the logs file, and the [SSL certificates that you backed up](certificates.md#backup-and-restore-certificates). This command will not touch your cluster.

## Local only

### Removing CA from the trusted store

If you [installed the mkcert CA (Certificate Authority) to your trusted store,](../kubefirst/local/github/install.md#install-the-ca-certificate-authority-of-mkcert-in-your-trusted-store-optional) you can remove it with:

```shell
mkcert -uninstall
```
