To destroy your kubefirst cluster , run the `kubefirst <platform> destroy`.

<!--tabs-->
# AWS

```shell
kubefirst aws destroy
```

# Civo

kubefirst cluster destroy

# k3d

```shell
kubefirst k3d destroy

<!--/tabs-->

The command will also delete everything added to your GitHub or GitLab account, while cleaning local files related to your deployment.

## reset (optional)

kubefirst has a `reset` command that cleans local files (only) generated by the installer while leaving the logs file, and the [SSL certificates that you backed up](../../explore/certificates/#backup-and-restore-certificates).

```shell
kubefirst reset
```

## Local only

### Removing CA from the trusted store

If you [installed the mkcert CA (Certificate Authority) to your trusted store,](../kubefirst/local/github/install#install-the-ca-certificate-authority-of-mkcert-in-your-trusted-store-optional) you can remove it with:

```shell
mkcert -uninstall
```
