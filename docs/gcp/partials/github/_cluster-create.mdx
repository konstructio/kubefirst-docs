## Create your new kubefirst cluster

Adjust the following command with your GitHub and Google Cloud tokens in addition to the appropriate values for your new platform.

```shell
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export gcp_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

kubefirst beta gcp create \
  --alerts-email yourdistro@your-company.io \
  --github-org your-github-org \
  --domain-name your-domain.io \
  --cluster-name kubefirst
```

<CloudflareDNS />

The kubefirst CLI will produce a directory of utilities, a state file, and some staged platform content that can now be found in the `~/.kubefirst` and `~/.k1` folders on your local machine.

After the ~10 minute installation, your browser will launch a new tab to the [kubefirst Console](https://github.com/kubefirst/console), which will help you navigate your new suite of tools running in your new Google Cloud cluster.

If your deployment is not successful, errors and troubleshooting information will be stored in a local log file specified during the installation run.
