### Unseal Vault

Vault may automatically seal itself with k3d if you restart Docker or your computer goes to sleep. Usually, you would have to retrieve all the three unseal keys, and manually enter them, but with Kubefirst, you can unseal Vault with one easy command:

```shell
kubefirst k3d unseal-vault
```
