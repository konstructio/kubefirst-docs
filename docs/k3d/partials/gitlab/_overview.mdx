`kubefirst k3d create` provisions a local [k3d](https://k3d.io) Kubernetes cluster to host your cloud native environment locally.

Your k3d cluster will include:

## Atlantis Example / User Creation Walkthrough

Onboard users with [GitHub](github/user-creation.md) or [GitLab](gitlab/user-creation.md) by doing a pull/mnerge request with Terraform changes to your `gitops` repository and applying the change using Atlantis.

## Deliver `metaphor` to your new Development, Staging, and Production Environments

Build and deliver a microservice using our example [metaphor application](../../explore/metaphor.md). Making any changes to the main branch of your new `metaphor` repository will build and deliver your application to your new cluster.
