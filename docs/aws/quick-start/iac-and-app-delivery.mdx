## Step 1: Console UI

Once the AWS platform has completed provisioning, the Console UI will provide you with a dashboard to navigate to some of the new services that were provisioned.

## Step 2: Add Your Team (optional while evaluating)

See our [guide](../../common/terraform.mdx) to onboard yourself and your team to the platform.

## Step 3: Deliver Metaphor to Development, Staging, and Production

Metaphor is our sample application that we use to demonstrate parts of the platform and to test CI changes.

If you visit its `/.github/workflows/main.yaml` in the metaphor repository, you'll see it's just sending some workflows to Argo in your EKS cluster. Those workflows are also in the `metaphor` repository in the `.argo` directory.

The metaphor pipeline will:

- Publish the metaphor container to your private ECR.
- add the metaphor image to a release candidate Helm chart and publish it to ChartMuseum.
- set the metaphor with the desired Helm chart version in the `gitops` repository for development and staging.
- the release stage of the pipeline will republish the chart, this time without the release candidate notation making it an officially released version and prepare the metaphor application chart for the next release version.
- the officially released chart will be set as the desired Helm chart for production.

To watch this pipeline occur, make any change to the `main` branch of the `metaphor` repository. If you're not feeling creative, you can just add a newline to the README.md. Once a file in `main` is changed, navigate to metaphor's CI/CD in the GitHub Actions tab to see the workflows get submitted to Argo Workflows.

You can visit the metaphor development, staging, and production apps in your browser to see the versions change and Argo CD syncs the apps. The metaphor URLs can be found in your GitOps and metaphor project `README.md` files.
