The command will also delete everything added to your GitHub or GitLab account, while cleaning local files related to your deployment.

## reset (optional)

You can use the `kubefirst reset` command to clean local files generated by the installer while leaving the logs file, and the [SSL certificates that you backed up](certificates.md#backup-and-restore-certificates) untouched. This command will not destroy your cluster (cloud resources or k3d), and is not a replacement for the `destroy` command.

## Local only

### Removing CA from the trusted store

If you [installed the mkcert CA (Certificate Authority) to your trusted store,](../kubefirst/local/github/install.md#install-the-ca-certificate-authority-of-mkcert-in-your-trusted-store) you can remove it with:

```shell
mkcert -uninstall
```
