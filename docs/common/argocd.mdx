Argo CD is a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. We use it to manage all of our applications across our Kubernetes clusters.

Argo CD is really great at providing a straightforward mechanism for you to manage Helm charts, their versions, their configuration overrides, and whether their state is in sync with what is running on your clusters.

## Managing Apps in Argo CD

The configuration for all of your apps in your Kubernetes cluster can be found in your new `gitops` repository at path `/registry/<cluster-name>`.

GitLab registry applications:

GitHub registry applications:

Each of these YAML files will include details regarding the application's source, destination, and Helm configuration overrides.

## Applying Changes in Argo CD

Once you change the desired state of the app in the `gitops` repository `main` branch, the registered app-of-apps will sync, and any apps in Kubernetes that need adjustment will automatically sync with the state that's in git.

## Adding Applications to Argo CD

The registry of our Argo CD apps are all in the `/registry` root directory. Any application added here will be added to Argo CD. An app can also be an app-of-apps if you require multiple components to be delivered as a suite. You'll see plenty of examples to follow in the `/registry` directory.
