## What is kubefirst?

kubefirst is a fully automated and operational open source platform that includes some of the most popular open source tools available in the Kubernetes space, all working together from a single command.

We support local, AWS, and Civo clouds. By running our CLI commands against your empty environment, you'll get a GitOps cloud management and application delivery ecosystem complete with automated Terraform workflows, Vault secrets management, GitLab or GitHub integrations with Argo, and demo applications that demonstrate how it all pieces together.
