kubefirst needs a GitHub token to authenticate with the GitHub API. The token is used to perform various actions on a user's behalf like the cluster creation, but also by Atlantis and Argo CD during your management, and workload clusters usage.

## How to create a GitHub Token

The easiest way is to start the kubefirst installer, and follow the screen instructions. It will guide you to issue a token with the list of scope described above to issue a GitHub Token using the [GitHub device login flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow).

You can also log in to your GitHub account and issue a Personal Access token following the [list of scopes below](#github-token-scopes). With the manually generated token, you can provide it via environment variable using `export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

:::tip
If you never connected to GitHub using SSH before and are creating a cluster using the CLI, be sure to add it to the known host using the command `ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` to ensure you won't get a `ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown` error.

### GitHub Token Scopes

![GitHub Token Scopes](../../../img/common/github/scopes.png)

kubefirst needs the following scopes or scopes groups:

| Scope                 | Score Permission                             | kubefirst Usage                                                                                         |

| admin:public_key      | Fully manage public keys                     | Needed for the kubefirst admin kbot user to take action in the repositories we created for you          |
| admin:repo_hook       | Full access to repository hooks              | Creating hooks for Atlantis to subscribe to some GitHub events (i.e., comments, pull requests...)       |
| admin:org_hook        | Full access to organization hooks            | This is will be removed soon (see [#2180](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/issues/2180))          |
| user                  | Grants read & write access to profile info   | Retrieving the user profile to display in the console UI & let the user validate the used token         |
| delete_repo           | Delete repositories                          | Deleting repositories managed by Infrastructure as Code with Atlantis                                   |
| admin:ssh_signing_key | Full control of public user SSH signing keys | This is will be removed soon (see [#2180](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/issues/2180))          |

You can read more about the [scopes in the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).

:::warning
Those permissions are the minimum requirement for kubefirst to function properly.

If you feel unease with that, we suggest you create a new GitHub user or organization for the sake of testing kubefirst.
