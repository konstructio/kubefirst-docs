Kubefirst needs a GitHub token to authenticate with the GitHub API. The token is used to perform various actions on a user's behalf like the cluster creation, but also by Atlantis and Argo CD during your management, and workload clusters usage.

## How to create a GitHub Token

The easiest way is to start the Kubefirst installer, and follow the screen instructions. It will guide you to issue a token with the list of scope described above to issue a GitHub Token using the [GitHub device login flow](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps#device-flow).

You can also log in to your GitHub account and issue a Personal Access token following the [list of scopes below](#github-token-scopes). With the manually generated token, you can provide it via environment variable using `export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

:::tip
If you never connected to GitHub using SSH before and are creating a cluster using the CLI, be sure to add it to the known host using the command `ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` to ensure you won't get a `ssh: handshake failed: knownhosts: key is unknown` error. If you get the `known_hosts file does not exist` error when running the previous command, it's because you are missing the `~/.ssh` folder, so run `mkdir ~/.ssh` and try the `ssh-keyscan` command again.

### GitHub Token Scopes

![GitHub Token Scopes](../../../img/common/github/scopes.png)

Kubefirst needs the following scopes or scopes groups:

<!-- vale off -->

<!-- vale on -->

You can read more about the [scopes in the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps#available-scopes).

:::warning
Those permissions are the minimum requirement for Kubefirst to function properly.

If you feel unease with that, we suggest you create a new GitHub user or organization for the sake of testing Kubefirst.
