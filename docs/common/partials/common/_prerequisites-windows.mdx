We currently do not support Windows directly, but you can easily use kubefirst using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (tested with Ubuntu). To install the latest WSL version, please follow the [Microsoft documentation on how to install Linux on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
