You can download the latest build for your architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/releases). Once done, extract it, and ensure it's executable. You may need to use `sudo` for the `tar` or `chmod`` command.

```shell
tar --overwrite -xvf kubefirst_<VERSION>_linux_<ARCH>.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/kubefirst && \
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubefirst
```

Now you can run `kubefirst`.

```shell
kubefirst version
```
