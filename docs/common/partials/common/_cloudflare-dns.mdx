By default kubefirst use the cloud providers to manage DNS. You also have the option to use Cloudflare.

To do so, add the `dnsProvider` flag with the value `cloudflare` to your create command `—dnsProvider cloudflare`. You also need to set the `CF_API_TOKEN`environment variable with the Cloudflare token `export CF_API_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxx`.
