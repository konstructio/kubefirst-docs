## General

### I ran into an issue, what should I do?

If an error occurs, try to run the command again: there is a `~/.kubefirst` file on your localhost that keeps track of your execution state. If it still doesn't work, check the log file which was created in the `~/.k1/logs` folder.

If you are not sure about the steps to take to fix the problem you encounter, join our [Slack community](https://kubefirst.io/slack), and ask for help in the `#helping-hands` channel. We'll gladly work through it with you.

If you think there is a bug, you can also open an [issue](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/issues) describing the problems you are having.

### I'm experiencing timeouts when kubefirst deploys Argo CD or HashiCorp Vault through the Helm installations

You may need a more stable connection / higher download speed. Check with your internet provider or use an online speed test to confirm you have at least 100mbps download speed, or else you may experience timeouts.

### Where can I find the services passwords?

Run the command `kubefirst <platform> root-credentials` where `<platform>` is one of `k3d`, `aws`, `civo`

### I'm stuck with artifacts after a failed local installation and can't continue

If you still cannot complete the installation due to remaining artifacts after completing a `kubefirst k3d destroy`, you may have to do a manual teardown. Firstly, you need to delete the k3d cluster with the following command:

```shell
$HOME/.k1/tools/k3d cluster delete kubefirst
kubefirst reset
```

Once it's done, you can delete the GitHub assets we created by logging into your account and removing the `gitops`, and `metaphor` repositories. You can also use the GitHub CLI to do that1:

```shell
gh repo delete <GITHUB_USERNAME>/metaphor --confirm
gh repo delete <GITHUB_USERNAME>/gitops --confirm
```

### What is the wait.yaml file in each application components folder?

We've had issues with Argo CD and its sync waves not orchestrating correctly (it's a known bug, here's [one example](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/12376)), so we've added the `wait.yml` file as a secondary measure to help with the reliability of the platform provisioning. We may revisit how this is functioning, and remove those files on our platform orchestration evolution.
