# Contributing to the Kubefirst documentation

Firstly, we want to thank you for investing your valuable time to contribute to Kubefirst!

_⚠️ Please note that this file is a work-in-progress, so more details will be added in the future._

Note we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which needs to be followed in all your interactions with the project to keep our community healthy.

## Ways to Contribute

At Kubefirst, we believe that every contribution is valuable, not just the code one, which means we welcome

- [bug reports](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/issues/new);
- [feature requests](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=feature_request.md&title=);
- [documentations issues reports](https://github.com/kubefirst/kubefirst/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=feature_request.md&title=) like unclear section, missing information or even typos;
- and, of course, any code contributions to Kubefirst, or the documentations itself.

Before making a code change, first discuss your idea via an [issue](https://github.com/kubefirst/docs/issues/new/choose). Please check if a feature request or bug report does [already exist](https://github.com/docs/kubefirst/issues/) before creating a new one.
